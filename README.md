# £100m of premium bond prizes remain unclaimed

In August 2025, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3791ep6gko) more than £100m of premium bond prizes remained unclaimed amid criticism that the government-owned bank which operated the savings scheme was not doing enough to find the winners.

Among the 2.5 million unclaimed prizes were 11 winners of £100,000 - the second-largest prize available.

Critics said the process to trace accounts needed reform as it was too difficult for people gifted Premium Bonds, or those who only ever had paper records.

Operator National Savings and Investments (NS&I) said it had paid more than 99% of the prize-winners since starting its tax-free draws in 1957.
