In August 2025, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3791ep6gko) more than £100m of premium bond prizes remained unclaimed amid criticism that the government-owned bank which operated the savings scheme was not doing enough to find the winners.

Among the 2.5 million unclaimed prizes were 11 winners of £100,000 - the second-largest prize available.

Critics said the process to trace accounts needed reform as it was too difficult for people gifted Premium Bonds, or those who only ever had paper records.

Operator National Savings and Investments (NS&I) said it had paid more than 99% of the prize-winners since starting its tax-free draws in 1957.

Wills and probate solicitor Patrice Lawrence said she had helped seven people trace accounts including clients, and friends and family.

"It's shocking that a government-owned bank is sitting on nearly £100m [in unclaimed prizes] that doesn't belong to it during a cost of living crisis," she told the BBC.

# Our findings in brief

- UK-wide data showed nearly £100m in unpaid Premium Bonds winnings as at the end of March 2025, broken down by areas similar to counties, disclosed in response to an FOI request. All data were included by NS&I, but in some instances it has aggregated up to the areas with at least 100,000 bondholders. It meant in some cases rather than a county area, the data were at a higher level e.g. Wales (national) or Outer London/Inner London (regional) rather than Welsh county or London Borough etc. This is because NS&I said it did not hold data for all local authorities as they did not all meet its 100,000 Bondholder rule for publishing data: https://www.nsandi.com/get-to-know-us/prize-winner-locations. *When NS&I responded to our request for comment, the unclaimed prizes had reached £103m.
- There were 6 unclaimed winners of £100k each as of 31 March 2025 - the second-largest prize available - in “Overseas/Unknown”, Avon, Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Hereford and Worcester and Outer London – the bond numbers of these winners are included in the spreadsheet. NS&I defined an “unclaimed” prize as a draw more than 18 months ago and which not yet been paid out. The NS&I said in a subsequent press release that as of June 2025, more than 2.5 million premium bond prizes worth over £103 million remained unclaimed. This included 11 £100,000 prizes, 19 £50,000 prizes, 38 £25,000 prizes and 75 prizes of £10,000 (but the bank did not include locations for the bond holders who won these prizes).
- The oldest unclaimed prize was £25 won in November 1957 in South Yorkshire. NS&I said where two or more prizes were tied at being the highest value or oldest for each area - one was chosen at random.
- Nearly 23 million people had Premium Bonds accounts worth a combined £130bn, as of 31 March 2025.
- The value of accounts with no activity for more than 20 years, as of 31 March 2025, was £784m.
